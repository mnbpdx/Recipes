Original Recipe:

2 large egg yolks
3/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
1/2 cup coconut oil, in liquid state
1/3 cup unsulphered molasses (I used robust molasses; light or medium may be used; blackstrap will likely be too pungent)
2 tablespoons vanilla extract
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoons ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
pinch salt, optional and to taste
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda

Cinnamon-Sugar Coating
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon

DIRECTIONS:

Cookies -
1. To the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment 
(or use large mixing bowl and hand mixer; or simply whisk together in a 
large bowl), combine the egg, brown sugar, coconut oil (measure like you’d
measure vegetable or olive oil; you need 1/2 cup of liquid-state coconut 
oil; if your coconut oil is in a solid state, microwave enough so you get 
1/2 cup liquid-state coconut oil), molasses, vanilla, and beat on medium-high 
speed until well-mixed, smooth, and glossy about 4 minutes.

2. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the cinnamon, ginger, 
cloves, nutmeg, optional salt, and beat on medium-high speed until combined 
and smooth, about 1 minute.

3. Stop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add the flour, baking soda, and 
mix until just combined, about 1 minute.

4. Form roughly 1 tblsp mounds (very small, like 20+). Place mounds on a large 
plate, cover with plasticwrap, and refrigerate for an hour.

5. Preheat oven to 350F, line baking sheets with Silpats, or spray with cooking
spray; set aside.

Cinnamon-Sugar Coating – 
6. Add granulated sugar and cinnamon to a small bowl 
and stir to combine.

7. Roll each ball of dough through the coating, liberally coating all sides. 
After all cookies have been coated, I like to go back and double-dip each 
mound, to get an extra-thick coating.

8. Place coated mounds on baking sheets, bake for ~9.5 minutes. Do NOT overcook.
Allow cookies to cool on baking sheets for about 5 minutes before removing and 
transferring to a rack to finish cooling.

Storage:
Store cookies airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer 
for up to 4 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight 
in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so 
consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough 
to be baked in the future when desired. Do not roll cookies through cinnamon-sugar 
mixture until you plan to bake them.
